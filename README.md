# Breast Cancer Detection using Decision Tree (CART)

This repository contains MATLAB code for implementing a Decision Tree (CART) algorithm for the detection of breast cancer. The code includes data loading, data management, feature selection using MRMR (Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance), model training, evaluation, and visualization of the decision tree.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- MATLAB installed on your machine.
- Ensure that the dataset file (`breast_cancer_wisconsin.mat`) is in the 'DataSets' folder.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/abidi-a/DT-MRMR.git
